Nowadays, as the majority of small children are reliant on technology like mobile phone, tablets, and laptop for entertainment and education, this app will be an amalgamation of fun, excitement and entertainment, while still educating and nurturing the young minds.
AR Pre - School app is an app that will help children study the building blocks of English language; the alphabets, by interactively showcasing 3D models of an item in respect with the word while textually as well as verbally providing information about it. The 3D images will pop up to life whenever you hover our AR Pre - School app on the 2D precoded image which could be downloaded online. They could also share the images on Social media, share with their friends through email, messenger, WhatsApp or, save in the gallery.
